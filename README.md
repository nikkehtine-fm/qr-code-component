## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

After some time of idling, I could revise some HTML and CSS, and have fun with problem solving.

Check out my usage of CSS variables and grid layout:

```css
body {
  font-family: Outfit, sans-serif;
  font-size: 15px;
  text-align: center;
  margin: 0;
  height: 100vh;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  /* Variables */
  --width: 288px;
  --lgray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  --gblue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
  --dblue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```
